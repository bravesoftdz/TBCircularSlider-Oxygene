# TBCircularSlider (Oxygene)
========================

This small sample project is an Oxygene port of the TBCircularSlider example originally by Yari D'areglia.

The original sample was discussed on Yari D'areglia's blog at [here](http://www.thinkandbuild.it/how-to-build-a-custom-control-in-ios) and the code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ariok/TB_CircularSlider) as well.

This project adds or subtracts nothing, and merely shows how the exact same code would look in Oxygene "Nougat" and thus serves as an example for how to create custom native iOS controls in the Oxygene language.
